## Part A: Why This App?

This app merges two of my core interests: **gaming and personal productivity**.  
By turning daily responsibilities into quests, it transforms mundane habits into exciting challenges—rewarding consistency and encouraging growth over time.

## Part B: Configuring SSL Certificates

### Certificate Generation Using OpenSSL

I used **OpenSSL**, a widely adopted toolkit, to create a self-signed SSL certificate for local development.

### Steps Taken

1. Create a new folder for the project  
   `mkdir Barrera_Phase1`

2. Open terminal in VSCode or your editor of choice.

3. Create a certificate directory:  
   `mkdir cert`

4. Generate private key and certificate:  
   ```bash
   openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout cert/server.key -out cert/server.cert
